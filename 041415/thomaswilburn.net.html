                  Another enterprise Seattle Times investigation, this piece focused on the broken promises of the Washington State prison labor industry. I worked on the visualizations for this piece, including the logo design. But it's most interesting to me because it serves as the debut for two new custom elements &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/seattletimes/responsive-frame">&lt;responsive-frame&gt;</a> for embedding elements, and <a href="https://github.com/seattletimes/component-leaflet-map">&lt;leaflet-map&gt;</a> for assembling the state map.

                  The work done on this "parallax-ish" presentation is reasonably interesting, technically, but most of the credit for its impressive impact comes from the stellar Seattle Times photo staff. We worked hard to make the source inputs for this gallery easy to replace, which meant that we could also spin up a variation on <a href="http://projects.seattletimes.com/2015/seahawks-top-moments/superbowl/">Super Bowl night</a> with relatively little effort.

                  The culmination of a year-long investigative effort, I worked on all the interactive elements for this story about lead poisoning at gun ranges in Washington State and around the country. In addition to the header and page design, I worked on the string-of-pearls chart, the interactive maps, and the cutaway diagram of Wade's shooting range. Our design was featured in a Q&A with the <a href="http://www.snd.org/2014/11/the-guts-seattle-times-project-lets-users-leave-fingerprints/">Society for News Design</a>.

                  For the mid-term election, I built a scraper for the Washington Secretary of State and King County data feeds, as well as a results page with embedded maps and bar graphs of the results. The maps in particular are interesting, being built as custom elements (a first for a news organization, as far as I'm aware). The backend for this project was developed in public, and is available <a href="https://github.com/seattletimes/elections-2014">on GitHub</a>.

                  When a Times business reporter showed me his "heat map" of where Seattle house-hunters face the toughest competition, I knew it could be a dynamite interactive graphic. Built on Angular, this page lets users search for a neighborhood, filter by city, and find out just how badly they'll probably need to overbid in order to buy a new home.

                  In 2013, the Seattle Times put out a "fan map" built on Google Fusion Tables, letting Seahawks fans tag themselves around the globe. It was a success, but we wanted something more scalable for 2014. The new version has marker clustering, AJAX form submission, and a much more polished look-and-feel. It also successfully leveraged our news app template, and the ability to use Google Docs as an ad-hoc CMS.

                  This Seattle Times interactive was designed to let readers explore more than 80 years of history leading up to the 2014 Oso landslide that killed 43 people. Reporters gathered 13 aerial photos dating back to 1933, as well as data on all of the houses, logging, red flags, and attempted fixes for the hill. I arranged the timeline vertically, which makes it easier to scroll on desktop and mobile, and linked its progress to the photos so that readers could flip through them and watch the river gradually eat away at the base of the hill.

                  Each year, the Seattle Times ranks the top companies native to the Pacific Northwest, according to various performance metrics. As one of my first projects at the paper, I helped assemble this package, which combined a custom fullscreen parallax (to showcase impressive work by our photographer) and a sortable, filtered table built in AngularJS.

                  In this project, the CQ newsroom wanted to understand legislators who vote against the party line--why do they go "against the grain?" What kinds of votes garner the most dissent? To let people browse through our database of party unity votes, we built this web application in object-oriented Javascript and HTML. As readers move through the data, new panels will open to the right, but they can return to an earlier fork in their search at any time. This interactive was a powerful experiment, not just as a standalone interactive, but also as an exploration of new UI for CQ's extensive (but cumbersome) vote database.

                  As the debt limit debate neared its deadline, my team at CQ produced several graphics on the history of the debate, past attempts to raise the limit, and the composition of the debt in question. In this interactive, built in HTML/JavaScript, we pulled apart the components of the debt to see just what was owed to whom. It was featured, along with its companion, on the front page of the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/07/federal-debt">Economist's web site</a>.

                  The Economy Tracker was a flagship multimedia production for CQ: an interactive data visualization of more than 40 years of economic data at the national, regional, and state levels, split into 6 indicator sets. Behind the scenes, it communicates with our PostgreSQL database via a custom PHP server, which also allows reporters to easily upload CSV files for data updating. The server scripts expose a simple REST/JSON API, creating a base for other economic data visualizations and mashups, such as <a href="http://innovation.cq.com/media/unemployment_2000_2011/">this map of post-recession unemployment</a>.

                  Each year, CQ does an elaborate vote study for all 535 members of Congress, resulting in scores for their party unity (how often they voted with the leadership) and presidential support (how often they voted with the president's pre-announced positions). These are published in the weekly magazine, and in 2009 they accompanied an article on the rising influence of moderates. For the online audience, I created an interactive component to accompany the story online, allowing readers to explore the data in both tabular and rich graphical format. At the end of 2010, I <a href="http://innovation.cq.com/media/vote_study_2010/">updated the visualization to be faster</a>, and to support multiple years of data on the same canvas. The <a href="http://innovation.cq.com/media/2011/votestudy_2011/">most recent version</a> adds data going back to 2002, and provides a more convenient, multi-axis visualization of each year.

                  You could argue that it's as much as web company as a game company &mdash; certainly the thousands of lines of JavaScript in its services cloud can speak to that. At ArenaNet, I wrote front- and back-end code for our NodeJS-like platform, including the marketing, account infrastructure, and developer APIs. I also worked on improvements to the in-game UI for <i>Guild Wars 2</i>, the company's award-winning MMO, which is partially embedded in a web view and uses cutting-edge, single-page application technology.

                  In 2013, I bought a Chromebook and was shocked to discover that there wasn't a good offline 
text editor available for Chrome OS, so I built one myself. Caret is a professional-grade 
tabbed text editor built around the <a href="http://ace.c9.io">Ace editing component</a>. It 
features fully-configurable menus and keybindings, open file memory, a command/go-to 
palette, and more. It's the best offline editor available on Chrome OS, and it's 
battle-tested--every version since 0.0.16 has been written in Caret, and it's been used by 
members of the Chromium team to work on the browser itself.

                  In the wake of the Google Reader shutdown announcement, I decided to try writing my own self-hosted RSS reader before I would move to another third-party service. Weir was completed right before the deadline, and I've been using it since. It's written in Node and PostgreSQL for the server-side components and Angular on the front-end, and it boasts a fully-responsive design for viewing on phones or desktop machines alike.

                  At CQ, I had often trained journalists as part of my multimedia team, but when my wife and I moved to Seattle I decided to take the next step, and began teaching classes in JavaScript and web development at <a href="http://seattlecentral.edu">Seattle Central College</a>. As always, teaching others is a great way to really learn a topic yourself, and I've learned quite a bit. I'm also working with the full-time faculty to shape and improve the curriculum for front-end development.

                  In 2012, I spent about a year working for Big Fish Games in Seattle on their Big Fish Unlimited streaming service. I rebuilt the MVC framework that supported the site (laying the groundwork for future BFG properties), designed the responsive framework used to present it on any form factor (desktop, tablet, and mobile), and wrote all the JavaScript in AMD modules (a first for Big Fish). The JavaScript made heavy use of pub/sub events, allowing us to decouple the native or plugin layer that did the actual streaming on each device from the display logic on the rest of the page.

                  In my spare time, starting in 2009, I started contributing to NPR's open-source Android client, primarily by splitting the playback function apart from the UI code. This helped lay the groundwork for the 2.0 version of the application, and it makes the application much more Android-friendly for users. Working with NPR and Google on this application was a fantastic learning experience for source control, code review, and mobile application design.

                  As the Director of Interactive Media for Urban Artistry, a non-profit dance company based in Maryland, I'm responsible for our online presence. People interested in UA may be accessing the Internet primarily on mobile devices or older hardware, particularly those who are coming to our events. So when we got a chance to redesign the site for a cleaner, more modern look, I took the opportunity to write a completely custom WordPress theme that is responsive and fast, but still runs effectively in legacy browsers. The look and feel is inspired by our logo, which combines evocative whitespace with a bold red splash.
